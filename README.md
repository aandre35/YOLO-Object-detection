# YOLO Object localization and detection

In this project, we will put into practice some of the methods presented in class to locate objects in an image.

In localization and detection, we try to determine the position of an object, as well as its class, in the form of a bounding box of width $b_w$ and height $b_h$, and whose center has the coordinates of the point $(b_x, b_y)$.

The localization problem considers that only one object is present on the image, while the detection problem seeks to determine the set of objects present on the image.
